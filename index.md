Is my world a reflection of my own mind?  Am I the curator?  Or the Navigator?  The world the labrynth of the mind, the director/writer the centaur/bull at the center, the self the hero that must conquer the centaur.

### Kubrick & The Shining

### the writer in M83

## What is the Labrynth?

# The Beginning of a New Me

I added headers to the file, with some breif descriptions.
